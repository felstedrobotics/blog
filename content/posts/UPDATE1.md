# What We've be up to
 
Our team has been busy working and brain storming ways in which we could excel in this project. This is a completly new challange for all 4 of our team, so tackling each complex element individually has proved to be a time consuming task. Despite this, we collectivly didn't feel as though this has impendeded our project. We have stayed commited to the tasks and have worked meticulously through stages like creating our video and ensuring we have all the nessacary points on our robot. 
Collectivly we have had alot of work on our plates, all balancing out Maths, Computer Science and Physics along with many extra curriculars. This has caused us to be more delayed then other groups for relaying information back to the organisers, however this is NOT going to result in our project being behind any of our competetors.
