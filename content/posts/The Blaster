# The Rover

	Ever post apocalyptic film has cool car. Wether its the rigid 'War Rig' from Mad Max, or the slick and speedy "LawMaster" from Judge Dredd, all post apocalyptic media is centered around the car. Therefore the Felsted Robotics team knew the rover had to be special. Many mood boards later, the team took inspiration from Halo's warthog. We chose the warthog because of it's loud, robust design with iconic wheels and a blaster overlooking its enemies.

Our group started our design process with pen and pencil. Our pen and paper drafts helped create a visual representation of our first draft. After creating a first design, we started on CAD. We used onshape to construct a 3d model of the rover. We started with a 2d base layer working our way up to doors and eventually the roof.
